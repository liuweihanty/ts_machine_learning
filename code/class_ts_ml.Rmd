Load relevant packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(rpart)
```

Read in data
```{r}
ts <- read.csv("/Users/weihan/Documents/GitHub/ts_machine_learning/data/work_data.csv")
ts <- ts[-1]
ts <- column_to_rownames(ts,"Gene")
ts <- ts[-c(1,2)]
```


Preprocess the data
```{r}

```





Build classification tree
```{r}
# Load the rpart package
library(rpart)
# Build a lending model predicting loan outcome versus loan amount and credit score
loan_model <- rpart(outcome ~ loan_amount + credit_score, data = loans, method = "class", control = rpart.control(cp = 0))

# Make a prediction for someone with good credit
predict(loan_model, good_credit, type = "class")

# Make a prediction for someone with bad credit
predict(loan_model, bad_credit, type = "class")
```
