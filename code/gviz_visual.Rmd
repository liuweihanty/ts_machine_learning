Load the following package needed:
1) Gviz to perform visualization
2) GenomicRanges to build object read by Gviz 
3) biomaRt to retreive coordinates by gene name 
```{r setup}
library(Gviz)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(biomaRt)
```

Load the lists of interest:
1) list of CDR genes
2) list of TS from regression RF
3) list of TS from classfication RF
4) list of TS from data mining by Jeremy


genome track --> hg38
```{r load lists}
#2. list of ts from regression RF
reg.rf <- read.table("../data/gwide_hema_regression/ranked_result.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
reg.rf.ts <- reg.rf$Gene

#3. list of ts from classification RF
class.rf <- read.csv("../data/gwide_hema_classification/pred_hits_CGC.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
class.rf.ts <-class.rf$Gene

#4. list of TS from data mining by Jeremy
jeremy <- read.csv("../data/96ts_work_data.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
jeremy.ts <-jeremy$Gene
